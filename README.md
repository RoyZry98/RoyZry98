Hi!😊 I am a dual Ph.D. student at Nanjing University and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I am co-supervised by Prof. Yuan Du from NJU and Prof. Dan Wang from PolyU. I'm also working closely with Prof. Shanghang Zhang from Peking University. My broad interest💡 lies in Efficient and Generalization Learning towards Open-world Multimodal Systems, especially for applications of autonomous driving 🚗 and robots 🤖. I am also focusing on Neural Video Delivery 🎬.
